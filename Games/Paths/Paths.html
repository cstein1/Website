  <br>
  <b>GOAL OF GAME:</b>
  Your characters leave behind a blue trail which no character can cross. <br>
  You cannot continue to the next level until all red spaces have been painted <br>
  blue and your character has reached a respective goal.<br><br>
  Use arrow keys to navigate your character.<br>
  Use the 'r' key to skip this stage (your score will become 0).<br>
  Press the top left button to play with two characters! (WASDA for the second player)<BR>
  <br>
  Maps are randomly generated and thus have varied difficulty. Enjoy endless levels!
